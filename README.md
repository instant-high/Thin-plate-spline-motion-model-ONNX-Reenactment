# Thin-plate-spline-motion-model-ONNX-Reenactment
EDIT: reenact_v02

- removed face parsing, try to remove shoulder movement, set driving video to same fps as target video

- --audio replaces target audio with driving audio. (will make it selectable next update)

- still work in progress


Another extended version for Video-2-Video and Video-2-Image portrait animation.

Maybe outdated models... Work in progress, some things to be added for better results.

Only Vid2Vid for now.

Use driving video frontal face with not too much head movement for best results

Some results:
